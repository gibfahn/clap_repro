    First line docs for subcommand foo, always shown.

    Extra docs for subcommand foo, only shown in long help.

    `clap_repro foo --help` -> long help (as expected)
    `clap_repro foo -h` -> short help (as expected)
    `clap_repro help foo` -> short help (unexpected)

    Examples:

    ‚ùØ clap_repro foo # Does nothing.
    */
    Foo,
}
